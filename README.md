## Inspiration
Often times, clubs require the use of extrinsic rewards that are feasibly obtained in order to attract and retain, regardless of the intrinsic value that the club offers. We want to club managers and club members to have the opportunity to stray away from the immediate extrinsic rewards and allow the club to fully demonstrate their intrinsic values without adding much effort to do so.

## What it does
Club Coin is a blockchain-based system designed to incentivize and track club participation. By attending events and engaging with their communities, members earn coins that can be redeemed for rewards. This system fosters greater involvement and accountability within clubs while leveraging decentralized technology for transparency and security.

### Key Features
- **Participation Tracking:** Members can earn coins for attending and engaging in club activities, at the discretion of the club.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Transactions and rewards are securely stored on-chain for transparency and security.
- **Incentivization Mechanism:** Clubs can create reward structures to recognize active members and motivate prospective members.
- **Seamless Authentication:** Users can easily sign in and interact with the platform via Privy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with a TSX (TypeScript Execute) React frontend and Tailwind CSS for a smooth and modernized user experience.

## How we built it
For the frontend UI, Club Coin utilizes TSX React and Tailwind CSS for an interactive and responsive UI. Additionally, this allows a seamless connection with the Node JS backend to ensure proper communication between the different modules used in the project.

Club Coin also utilizes a blockchain supported by Solidity smart contracts to manage coin distribution and transactions with tight security and validation to provide a seamless experience to those using it for their clubs.

In order to provide a more seamless and secure experience for the club members, Club Coin implements Privy which provides an easy user onboarding process as well as secure management of digital wallets.

## Challenges we ran into
Many of us dove into new technologies that we have never learned before and required some time to get a base understanding of the technolgies and packages that we were responsible for. Some notable examples were understanding how to use React and Tailwind together for passable UI and interactions, Privy for providing a wall of security in accessing the Club Coins, and understanding how to connect these technologies into a single, seamless experience.

Additionally, with Club Coin associating closely with a type of currency, it was essential that the security and verification of the transactions and method of obtaining Club Coins were rigorously tested and evaluated in addition to ensuring that all packages and modules used were implemented as intended without any unexpected behavior. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was one of the first times we worked with blockchain technology. While the field of blockchain extends far beyond what we have done in this project, with the help from knowledgable group members and mentors, we were successful in our dive into understanding and working with some part of blockchain technology. 

## What we learned
Working on this project required knowledge of blockchain technologies and knowledge of implementations of the blockchain technologies. This required us to conduct extensive research to understand how a blockchain works and how to implement a blockchain. Regardless of the outcome, we were still successful in understanding how blockchains can be managed and utilized to provide value to consumers and enjoyed the process of learning these throughout the development of the project.

## What's next for Club Coin
If given more time, we would love to provide the ability for Club Coin to have a smart contract for coin issuance and reward redemptions. Additionally, we pride ourselves in providing a seamless user experience and would like to continue building and refining the UI with much more user imput for a more intuitive user experience.
